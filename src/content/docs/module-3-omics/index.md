title: "Module 3: Omics Analysis"
---

This module marks the transition from computational literacy to biological discovery. After Linux fundamentals (Module 1) and environment management (Module 2), you now apply these skills to high-throughput sequencing data and complete end-to-end analysis workflows.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the omics hierarchy and flow of information from genotype to phenotype
- Interpret the core sequencing file formats used in analysis workflows
- Run reproducible quality-control workflows with FastQC and MultiQC
- Compare de novo and reference-based assembly strategies
- Execute long-read de novo and reference-guided assembly pipelines

## Lessons

- Lesson 1: The omics hierarchy and file architecture
  - Covers the biological omics layers and the FASTQ/FASTA/BAM/VCF data model
- Lesson 2: Precision quality control (QC)
  - Introduces Phred scoring, FastQC, and MultiQC interpretation
- Lesson 3: Genome assembly foundations
  - Explains assembly concepts, coverage, repeats, and tool choices
- Lesson 4: De novo assembly with long reads
  - Walks through host-read filtering, assembly with Flye, and BLAST annotation
- Lesson 5: Reference-based assembly
  - Covers mapping to ACMV references, QC metrics, and consensus generation

> Note: Use your `bioinfo` environment for tool-heavy practical lessons.
